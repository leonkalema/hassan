# 🚀 Sequential Translation Pipeline Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the **NASA-grade sequential translation pipeline** that processes translations one by one with AI quality validation and "done" status marking.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. **GitHub Action Trigger** (`/.github/workflows/sync-translations.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push to repository with changes to `en.json`
- **Action**: Uploads English source to Supabase Storage
- **Queue**: Creates translation jobs for all supported languages
- **Priority**: High priority for `sv`, `de`, `fr`, `ja`, `zh`

### 2. **Database Schema** (`/supabase/migrations/001_create_translation_jobs.sql`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE translation_jobs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  locale VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  priority INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 2,
  source_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  ai_review_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  ai_review_score INTEGER,
  ai_review_notes TEXT
);
```

### 3. **Sequential Translation Worker** (`/supabase/functions/translation-worker/index.ts`)
- **Process**: One job at a time, ordered by priority
- **AI Translation**: Bulk translation with GPT-4o-mini
- **AI Review**: Quality assessment with scoring (1-100)
- **Status Marking**: Adds "done" marker for quality scores ≥70
- **Retry Logic**: Max 3 attempts per job
- **Rate Limiting**: 300ms between batches

### 4. **Fast Translation Server** (`/supabase/functions/serve-translation/index.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Read-only, instant translation serving
- **Caching**: In-memory cache with 5-minute TTL
- **Fallback**: Automatic English fallback if translation missing
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times

### 5. **Cron Job Trigger** (`/supabase/functions/translation-cron/index.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Automatically triggers translation worker
- **Frequency**: Can be scheduled (e.g., every 5 minutes)
- **Monitoring**: Tracks worker execution status

### 6. **Next.js Client** (`/src/lib/translation/edge-translator.ts`)
- **Fast Loading**: Uses fast translation server
- **Smart Caching**: Client-side cache with TTL
- **Quality Logging**: Shows AI review scores and completion status
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation to English

## 🔄 Translation Flow

```
1. Developer pushes code with en.json changes
   ↓
2. GitHub Action uploads en.json to Supabase Storage
   ↓
3. GitHub Action creates translation jobs in database
   ↓
4. Translation Worker processes jobs sequentially:
   - Fetches next pending job (by priority)
   - Translates content with AI (bulk processing)
   - Reviews translation quality with AI
   - Marks translation as "done" if quality ≥70
   - Saves translation file to Supabase Storage
   ↓
5. Fast Translation Server serves completed translations
   ↓
6. Next.js frontend loads translations instantly
```

## 🎯 Quality Control

### AI Review Criteria
- **Accuracy**: Meaning preserved from English
- **Fluency**: Natural target language flow
- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Local context awareness
- **Marketing Effectiveness**: Tourism industry tone
- **Consistency**: Terminology alignment
- **Completeness**: No English text remaining

### Quality Scores
- **90-100**: Excellent (marked as "done")
- **70-89**: Good (marked as "done")
- **50-69**: Needs review (not marked as done)
- **0-49**: Poor (requires manual review)

### Translation Status Markers
```json
{
  "_translationStatus": {
    "status": "completed",
    "quality": "excellent",
    "completedAt": "2025-01-06T18:15:00Z",
    "done": true
  },
  "meta": {
    "qualityReview": {
      "score": 95,
      "status": "excellent",
      "notes": "Perfect translation with natural flow",
      "reviewedAt": "2025-01-06T18:15:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Performance Benefits

### Sequential Processing
- **Reliability**: No race conditions or duplicate work
- **Resource Efficiency**: Controlled API usage
- **Quality Focus**: Each translation gets full attention
- **Monitoring**: Clear job status tracking

### Fast Serving
- **Instant Loading**: Pre-generated translations
- **CDN Caching**: Global distribution
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always functional
- **Client Caching**: Reduced server load

## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Supabase Functions
```bash
# Deploy translation worker
supabase functions deploy translation-worker

# Deploy fast translation server  
supabase functions deploy serve-translation

# Deploy cron trigger
supabase functions deploy translation-cron
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
```bash
# GitHub Secrets
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Supabase Function Environment
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 4. Configure Cron Job (Optional)
Set up Supabase Edge Function cron to trigger translation worker every 5 minutes.

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Translation Job Status
```sql
SELECT 
  locale,
  status,
  ai_review_status,
  ai_review_score,
  attempts,
  created_at,
  completed_at
FROM translation_jobs 
ORDER BY priority, created_at;
```

### Quality Metrics
- Average AI review scores per language
- Translation completion rates
- Processing time per job
- Error rates and retry patterns
